## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
# Navigate to functions directory
cd /home/ciscodg/collabcanvas/functions

# Build TypeScript (already done)
npm run build

# Deploy functions to Firebase
firebase deploy --only functions

# Expected output:
# ✔ functions[us-central1-aiCanvasCommand]: Successful update operation
```

**What this deploys:**
- Updated `aiCanvasCommand` function with form generation support
- New JSON schema validation
- Enhanced AI system prompt

**Time:** ~2-3 minutes

---

### Step 2: Build Frontend

```bash
# Navigate back to project root
cd /home/ciscodg/collabcanvas

# Build production bundle
npm run build

# Expected output:
# ✓ built in ~400ms
# dist/ folder created with optimized build
```

**What this builds:**
- Form utilities (templates + layout engine)
- Updated Canvas component (stroke rendering)
- Enhanced useCanvasCommands hook
- All optimized and bundled

**Time:** ~30 seconds

---

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Firebase Hosting

```bash
# Deploy hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Expected output:
# ✔ hosting[collabcanvas]: file upload complete
# ✔ Deploy complete!
```

**What this deploys:**
- Optimized production build
- All static assets
- Updated application code

**Time:** ~1-2 minutes

---

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Check Functions Deployment:**
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log
   ```
   Look for successful deployment messages

2. **Visit Your App:**
   Open your Firebase Hosting URL (from deploy output)

3. **Test Authentication:**
   - Sign in with Google
   - Verify canvas loads

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Form type is required" error even with valid command

**Possible cause:** AI didn't parse formType correctly

**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Verify AI response includes `formType` parameter
3. Try exact phrase: "create a login form"

---

### Issue: Forms not appearing

**Possible cause:** Firebase Functions not updated

**Solution:**
1. Verify functions deployment: `firebase functions:log`
2. Check for errors in console (F12)
3. Redeploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions`

---

### Issue: Forms appear but borders missing

**Possible cause:** Stroke properties not rendering

**Solution:**
1. Check Canvas component has stroke support (should be deployed)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Verify Rectangle interface includes stroke/strokeWidth

---

### Issue: Forms not centered

**Possible cause:** Viewport dimensions not detected

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify window.innerWidth/Height available
3. May need to refresh page

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

After deployment and testing, verify:
- ✅ All 3 form types render correctly
- ✅ Forms centered properly in viewport
- ✅ All elements maintain specified spacing
- ✅ Colors match design specification exactly
- ✅ Forms sync across multiple users in real-time
- ✅ Borders visible on all form elements
- ✅ Error handling works for invalid inputs
- ✅ Z-index management prevents overlapping

---
